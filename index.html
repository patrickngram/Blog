	<p>This is a practice blog. <span style="color:blue"><em>The main reason</em></span> that I am creating this blog is so that I can get better at writing HTML code. I will use this blog to track my progess as I go on this journey to improve this skill. I realize that having a skill such as HTML coding is a valuable asset because it is a skill set that will propel my career in any direction that I want it to go in this internet age.</p>
	<p>I do realize that my skills are at a very elemtary level, but that is the whole purpose behind this blog. It will go from something that is very basic to something that is extraordinary once I master CSS and Java Script. I will also use this as an opportunity to utilize my graphic design skills and implement that into my blog. I am using <a href="http://htmldog.com/">HTMLDog</a> as a resources along with the help of my mentor Seth.</p>
	<p>Ultimately this is going to be the first piece in my web dev portfolio. I want to build a solid portfolio so that I can reference it to people and show them my skills and what I can contribute to a potential emplyer</p>
